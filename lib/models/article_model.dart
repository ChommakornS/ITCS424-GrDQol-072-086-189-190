      subtitle:
          'The lake at Badwater Basin, usually known for salt flats, formed in August and was at one point 7 miles long and two feet deep.',
      body:
          'Historic rainstorms that lashed California recently have kept a rare phenomenon around — a lake at famed hotspot Death Valley. The lake formed at Badwater Basin in August on what normally is a salt flat after Death Valley National Park saw heavy rains and flash floods caused by the remnants of Hurricane Hilary, park officials said. The atmospheric river events over the last two weeks brought heavy rain to much of California and will keep the lake around longer than it otherwise would exist, the park said in a statement Thursday. “Most of us thought the lake would be gone by October” park ranger Abby Wines said in the statement. “We were shocked to see it still here after almost six months. This week’s rain will extend how long the lake is here. Its too shallow to kayak in but it makes amazing reflections of the mountains.” Death Valley usually only gets around 2 inches of rain per year but it got just shy of 5 inches over the last six months almost entirely because of Hilary and the recent atmospheric river event the park said Thursday. Around 2.2 inches of rain fell in a single day during Hilary which hit California as a rare tropical storm. The floods damaged roads and other infrastructure. But it also left the lake which was at one point 7 miles long 4 miles wide and two feet deep the National Park Service said. Death Valley got 1.66 inches of rain earlier this week the National Weather Service said early Wednesday in a 72-hour precipitation report. A temporary lake at Badwater Basin is rare according to the park service. The basin is itself a former inland lake called Lake Manly which has long since dried up. It existed in two past periods and most recently dried around 10,000 years ago according to the park. While it is known for its all-time record as the hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth and scorching temperatures during summer even when not a record highs this week have been around the 50s to 60s. Average highs at Furnace Creek start to reach 90 degrees usually in April according to the park. The record for the hottest temperature ever recorded on the planet was at Furnace Creek in Death Valley on July 10 1913 according to the World Meteorological Organization with 134 degrees.',

          'Some Apple Vision Pro users love the new device. Many online thinks it`s dystopian.',
      subtitle:
          'Videos of people sporting the new augmented reality headset have caused a stir across social media in the last week.',
      body:
          'Recent videos of people sporting the Apple Vision Pro — a new augmented reality headset — have spurred discourse online around whether the device is dystopian or revolutionary. The wearable product, which costs 3,500, allows users to see apps, email, video games and more integrated with their real-world surroundings. Since its release last week, some people have shared video of themselves testing it out, while others have made videos observing people who look out of place while using it in public spaces. The devices introduction into the marketplace has generated comparisons between present-day society and the Netflix show “Black Mirror,” which explores the unease over technology and the future, and the 2018 film “Ready Player One,” which is based on the science fiction novel about a future in which people obsess over virtual reality. But tech enthusiasts who have gotten their hands on the product say it feels like a revolutionary next step in how people merge their devices with their lives. The Vision Pro was a leap in technology in the same way the car was an advancement on the horse, said Casey Neistat, a YouTuber with roughly 12.6 million subscribers who tests technology products regularly in his videos. “It is an imperfect product, but to me, at age 42, this is without a doubt the most profound piece of technology I have ever experienced, and that was not my expectation,” Neistat said. Isaac Mosna, a content creator who goes by Canoopsy, said that when he wore the Vision Pro around Toronto, where he lives, he got a few looks on public transit. But most people were not bothered by the headset. “Nobody really cared,” Mosna said. “You know, big cities have a lot of other things to worry about besides somebody wearing some goofy-looking goggles.” He posted a video to YouTube, where he has 240,000 subscribers, in which he said he wore the Vision Pro for 24 hours. Like Neistat, Mosna believes the Vision Pro is imperfect, citing its bulky hardware. But he said that the software feels futuristic and that it is most likely a sign of where Apple is headed. “Overall, Id say I think its like one of the most exciting pieces of technology I have ever used in my life,” he said. “And its really hard to explain the nuances of it, because its very much a product that is all about, like, experiencing it for the first time and trying it out.” Apple didnt immediately respond to a request for comment. In recent days, the conversation surrounding the Vision Pro appears to have reached an inflection point as more users started posting their takes on it, accompanied by video. One video showed a man crossing the street wildly swinging his head around allegedly using apps on the device. In another video, a man alleges he recorded himself getting arrested while driving a Tesla while wearing the device. He later clarified that the video was a skit. Some shared videos destroyed the pricey headset. Others took it to places laptop users frequent, like coffee shops, and used it there. Memes like “Distracted Boyfriend” have also been re-imagined to include the Vision Pro. An X user likened the behavior of people using the Vision Pro in public to how people behave when they take psychedelics. He followed up by saying that the opportunity to see a film on a massive screen the way the Vision Pro offers is a genuinely enticing prospect but that he simply couldnt afford the price point. At least one person made a fake video claiming people could use deepfake technology to replace faces while using the Vision Pro. The person later explained that the video was made using the editing software After Effects. Some of the videos appear to have been made to gain clout — Neistat pointed out that the users in the videos dont appear to actually be interacting with the Vision Pros interface. But other videos, like one Neistat posted of himself using the device in Times Square, have been posted in earnest to show off the Vision Pros capabilities. “I am a tech nerd and enthusiast through and through,” he said. “In my life, I have never experienced something that is such a quantum leap in technology as the Vision Pro.” Still, he added, “I agree that no one should wear these in public.” ',

          'Luna Luna review: Lost carnival designed by Basquiat, Dali and Hockney is the art event of the year',
      subtitle:
          'The Luna Luna fairground, which first opened in Germany in 1987, has been resurrected by Drake in Los Angeles after decades forgotten in shipping containers. Kevin EG Perry explores a magical exhibition featuring playful, immersive work from some of the greatest artists of the 20th century',
      body:
          'Luna Luna, like a dream, almost vanished from memory. In 1987, in Hamburg, the Austrian pop-star-turned-artist André Heller threw open the gates of a one-of-a-kind fairground. Inside, wandering circus acts performed in front of carousels and carnival rides designed by a crew of the greatest artists of their time. Some were already world famous, like Salvador Dalí, David Hockney and Roy Lichtenstein. Others were eccentric Europeans or the rising stars of the New York street art scene: Jean-Michel Basquiat, Kenny Scharf and Keith Haring. That summer, 300,000 lucky visitors swarmed into the park, immersing themselves in colourful, radical, witty, sometimes scatological art. Then, like a circus leaving town, Luna Luna packed up and disappeared. Heller had grand plans for his attractions to tour the world, but they never came to pass. Instead, Luna Luna ended up in storage, packed inside 44 hulking shipping containers somewhere in sun-bleached Texas. There it stayed for the next 35 years, forgotten by the art history books, with scarcely a mention online. Eventually, a few of those who remembered got word of its existence to Drake, whose entertainment company DreamCrew had the right combination of financial muscle (to the tune of 100m Dollar), live events experience and art nous to bring Luna Luna back to life. “Within a 30-second conversation of this existed, we were all in, DreamCrew s Anthony Gonzales told The New York Times about the moment he took the idea to the rapper. “How do we get involved?’” The first job was to open up the storage containers, and find out what state the contents were in after those decades in the desert. They were flown to California, where investors gritted their teeth and held their breath. When the doors were cracked, the production crew found snakes, scorpions and, miraculously, a well-preserved art dreamland still neatly packed away. So now here it is, back from the memory hole. In a cavernous warehouse in downtown Los Angeles, an exhibition titled Luna Luna: Forgotten Fantasy presents the lovingly restored jewels of this long-buried treasure. It is a wonderful way to spend a couple of hours, in the literal sense: it is a place that induces a childlike sense of wonder. On the day we visit, its busy with a mix of ages, but everyone seems to wear a curious, delighted smile. It brings to mind Kurt Vonneguts old line: “If this is not nice, I do not know what is.” You get a sense of what you are in for before you even make it inside the building: outside in the car park you enter the space through a recreation of Hellers own inflatable Dream Station. It looks a little like a bouncy castle version of a Dalek, a promising gateway to a new world. Inside, you are greeted by Kenny Scharfs painted swing chair ride and a host of sculptures, based on his psychedelic graffiti faces, that grimace and gurn like oversized cartoon characters. Beside them is a sublime carousel designed by the Austrian painter Arik Brauer. It is laden with fantastical creatures such as the “pferdehand” (“pferd” is German for “horse”), an orangey-brown hand with index finger outstretched and the legs of a steed, wearing a saddle. One of the few disappointments about Forgotten Fantasy is that, given the modern value of these art pieces, you’re no longer allowed to ride the pferdehand, or anything else for that matter. However you are, so long as you pay extra for a VIP Moon Pass, allowed to have a nose around inside David Hockneys Enchanted Tree pavilion. An installation based on scenery he originally created for a 1981 staging of Maurice Ravels opera The Child and the Spells, it initially doesnt look like all that much. Then the light show begins outside, and a recording of the Berlin Philharmonic playing exuberant waltzes by Johann II and Josef Strauss starts up, and suddenly you are a child again, picking your way through a towering forest. If Hockneys work invokes the innocence of childhood, then Austrian artist Manfred Deixs Palace of the Winds is a gift for the sniggering school kid in all of us. Back in the Eighties, Deix created a marquee for Luna Luna custom-designed for the performance of amplified farting accompanied by classical violin. Here, we are presented with the gorgeously illustrated murals to flatulence that decorated the venues proscenium, along with TV screens showing a concert violinist and a couple of bare-cheeked flatulists letting rip in an approximation of Strauss “The Blue Danube” waltz. Its joyful to watch, perhaps because of the juxtaposition of highbrow and lowbrow art, or because its always funny to see an arse address a microphone. Elsewhere, in a video installation about the history of Luna Luna, Keith Haring mentions that when Heller first approached him he asked him if he wanted to “do something for kids”. Haring was delighted by the idea. The artist loved amusement parks, and would go on to call his involvement a “fantasy project”. He flew to Germany to work with the German ride designer Peter Petz, hand-painting his signature characters and creating 3D versions of his crawling babies, crocodiles and dog-men. Again, its just a shame you cant climb aboard like you could in the Eighties. Today, we have to make do with the fact that Harings enormous industrially fabricated tarps, which once made great backdrops for park performers, are even better suited to the age of Instagram. In the exhibitions second large room, we find more monumental works, including Salvador Dalís Dalídom pavilion, a geodesic dome with a mirrored interior that you can clamber inside in order to snatch a kaleidoscopic glimpse of infinity, with an ambient soundtrack of Gregorian chants by Blue Chip Orchestra. Then theres Roy Lichtensteins Luna Luna Pavilion, a glass labyrinth encased in Lichtenstein-designed panels with a soundtrack by the Minimalist composer Philip Glass. The highlight, though, is surely Jean-Michel Basquiats painted ferris wheel, which springs to life every so often to the strains of Miles Daviss 1986 song “Tutu”. As Luna lore has it, it was only after Heller secured the rights to have Davis soundtrack the ride that Basquiat agreed to design it. The antique wooden wheel, which dates from 1933, was then painted by Viennese artisans in accordance with Basquiats instruction and design, the only time the artist ever remotely executed a work. It ended up covered with his idiosyncratic slogans (“BLEEDING FINGERS”, “PORNOGRAPHY”) and cartoonish street art illustrations of plates of spaghetti and dazed dogs. On the back of the wheel, another touch of the obscene: the wheel seems to spin around a monkeys rear end, tail up, butthole exposed to the world. Its only fitting, then, that the exhibition should come to an end with the Swiss artist Daniel Spoerris Crap Chancellery. Back in Hamburg, it was used as the entrance to the toilets. The facade is modelled to look like Albert Speers designs for Adolf Hitlers Reich Chancellery, an architectural symbol of Nazi grandeur and power. The artist mockingly drags Speers neoclassical design down into the muck, with huge mounds of plastic excrement displayed on columns. Spoerri, whose own father was murdered by Nazis in World War II, mercilessly mocks the fascist aesthetic. Like much of Luna Luna, it is grand, silly and lewd, yet strangely moving to see in its full glory. Like this magical fairground that came so close to slipping into obscurity, the value of taking a s*** on the Nazis should never be forgotten.',

          'FPL Gameweek 24: Ollie Watkins, Luis Diaz and five tips for players to sign this week',
      subtitle:
          'One defender, two midfielders and two forwards for FPL managers to consider this week',
      body:
          'Fantasy Premier League managers have some big decisions to make soon, with the signs of both double gameweeks and empty gameweeks ahead for different clubs. Liverpools game with Luton has been shifted due to their Carabao Cup final commitments, while Manchester City face Chelsea and Brentford in GW25 - a knock-on of their Club World Cup exploits at the end of last year. With that in mind, as well as the return of European football on the horizon, substitution selections and judging which players are in line for rotation at their clubs will become even more important. While the Arsenal performance was diabolical, there is not much doubt the Reds are one of the top two or three teams around and upcoming games favour them: Burnley at home, Brentford away, Luton at home - the latter two set to be a double-header in GW25. As such and with Mohamed Salah still sidelined, the smart play is still to have an attacker in the side for a free-scoring team with three of four available forwards always starting. And given his recent upturn in form, that suggests Luis Diaz is the one to have in the team. He is a midfielder in FPL terms and has two assists and a goal in his last three - while he is also 0.6m cheaper than another option, Diogo Jota. The Eagles have not been on a great run but there is a chance ahead to stem the leak of points and they will need key centre-back Joachim Andersen at his best for it. He picked up a couple of big scores earlier in the season but has averaged only 1.2 points per game across the last dozen - so although he is a possible low-priced differentiator, its palace form makes it a risk. Hosting an out-of-form Chelsea is a decent opportunity for a clean sheet, followed by facing two of the three most goal-shy teams in the league in succession, Everton and Burnley - the latter again at home. Andersen is just outside the top ten FPL defenders for total points this term; a well-timed couple of shutouts would see him comfortably back inside it. With one of the best home records in the Premier League, Aston Villa are a great side to pick the odd player from when fixtures are favourable - and that looks like the case now. Manchester United at home might have been slightly more routine two weeks ago but still looks a winnable game for Villa, while they follow that against Fulham (a), Nottingham Forest (h) and Luton (a). As such, Ollie Watkins return to form makes him an ideal choice. After a run of one goal in five, he now has two goals and five assists in the last four matches - averaging 8.5 ppg across that run. As an unexpected bonus, he is currently 0.1m cheaper than he was two weeks ago, despite 53% of teams owning him. If you are in the almost-half which do not, this might be the right time to join the majority. Around a third of FPL managers already own Kevin De Bruyne. It is over double that for Erling Haaland, a full 62%. But only a quarter own Phil Foden right now, despite his 124 points for the season putting him fourth in the total midfield list and two of those above him being injured or away on internationals. His hat-trick at Brentford on Monday night brought up 20 points in another sign of his special form this season. Sometimes there is no need to be too clever about picking good players who score or create plenty, and City face Everton this weekend before a double gamweek against Chelsea and Brentford  all three matches are at home. Maybe Foden gets rotated out for one but he is played 90 minutes in six of Citys last seven in the league and has notched five, six, eight, 12 and 20-point hauls along the way. Bargain hunters in need of a forward can look to the in-form Matheus Cunha, thriving at Gary O Neils Wolves and hitting four goals and three assists across his last five games. A hat-trick came against Chelsea and perhaps upcoming opponents might not be so accommodating, but Brentford, Tottenham and Sheffield United have all been pretty leaky this season and comprise three of the bottom six (with Chelsea another!) teams for goals conceded across the last six league games. A perfect time for Wolves to be attacking them then, given across the same run of fixtures they are the team with the joint-most goals scored in the top flight - and Cunha is our final selection as a potential differentiator with just 6% of teams holding him.',

      subtitle:
          'Last fall Ford agreed to a big raise for striking members of the United Auto Workers union. On Tuesday, they gave their shareholders an even bigger raise.',
      body:
          'The company announced it would give shareholders a second, supplemental dividend that will more than double the regular dividend they usually receive. The regular dividend is 15 cents a share. The special dividend is 18 cents a share. Ford reported reduced earnings in the fourth quarter due to the cost of the strike that started in the final two weeks of the third quarter and ran through most of October. The company said its adjusted earnings came in at 1.2 billion dollar, down from 2.1 billion dollar at the end of 2022. Even with the drop in fourth-quarter earnings, full-year earnings at Ford rose to 8.1 billion dollar from 7.6 billion for 2022. And that means the average profit sharing check for the 58,000 UAW members at Ford will be 10,416 Dollar, up from 9,176 Dollar a year earlier. But it said that it expects adjusted earnings before interest and taxes in 2024 of between 10 billion dollar to 12 billion Dollar. The high end of that range would reflect record profits by that measure for the company, said Ford CFO John Lawler. “We are no where near our earnings potential for Ford Motor,” CEO Jim Farley told investors Tuesday evening. The company had said during the strike that it could not afford the demands the United Auto Workers union was making, with Farley even arguing that meeting the union demands would cause Ford to go bankrupt. While the union did not get everything in its list of demands at the start of the strike, it did win an immediate pay increases of at least 11% for its members at the company, and 14 percentage points of additional guaranteed pay hikes during the 4-1/2 year life of the contract. It also granted workers a cost-of-living adjustment to pay to protect them from the effect of higher prices. Ford is the second automaker to increase payouts to shareholders since reaching the deal with the UAW. In November, GM announced a 10 billion share buyback and 33% dividend increase. Shares of Ford gained more than 6% in after-hours trading following the earnings report, guidance and news of the dividend.',
